# Car Class Prediction.

## Description: 

Project Description:

This project involves analyzing a dataset on vehicle attributes and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features. The dataset contains information on various attributes of vehicles, such as compactness, circularity, distance circularity, and other measurements.

The project aims to achieve the following objectives:

Data Ingestion: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file using the pd.read_csv() function.

Data Exploration: The initial exploration of the dataset is performed by examining the first few rows using the head() function. The shape of the DataFrame is also displayed to provide information about the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

Data Summary: Descriptive statistics of the dataset are computed using the describe() function, which provides statistical measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each numerical feature.

Data Information: The info() function is used to obtain information about the dataset, including the data types of each column, the number of non-null values, and memory usage.

Class Distribution: The distribution of the target variable, "class," is analyzed by using the value_counts() function to count the occurrences of each class category. This helps identify any class imbalance in the dataset.

Correlation Analysis: The correlation matrix is computed using the corr() function to examine the relationships between different numerical features. The correlation values indicate the strength and direction of linear relationships between pairs of variables.

The project utilizes various Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries provide functionality for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

By performing EDA on the vehicle dataset, this project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, which can be used for further analysis, modeling, and decision-making in the automotive industry
